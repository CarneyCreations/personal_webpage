            <!-- Short and casual biography -->
            <article>
                <!-- Bio -->
                <p> Being compassionate with a logical mindset, my ethos is centered around helping others, working with
                    people, and making improvements to everyday life. I am also very creative with a passion for art,
                    photography, gaming and design layout. </p>

                <!-- Passions -->
                <p> I love the outdoors and am in my element when out there exploring nature. Some of my favourite things to do are
                    hiking difficult trails, skiing down the mountains of Europe, or going camping out in the wild with a crackling
                    fire.
                    When I am not out exploring different places, I transfer this passion to discovering challenges, improving
                    efficiency, constructing clean designs and solving problems. This is what ultimately lead me to programming
                    which encompasses all of the above. It is a place for me to let this adventurous side loose and to explore
                    different ways of creating elegant designs/programs to help make lives better and easier. </p>

                <!-- Interests before programming -->
                <p> Before programming, my tech interests were around blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies which I
                    extensively studied and profited from for several years. It was only when I learnt about programming that I
                    considered switching career paths. With programming, I could plunge deeper into new emerging technologies and
                    become a bigger part of this sector. </p>

                <!-- Ambition -->
                <p>
                In the future, after extensive learning, my aim is to become a full-stack web developer. By linking together
                the challenges and problem-solving required for back-end development, with the design elements and layout of
                front-end I have my dream job. I love the excitement and sense of achievement felt when you <b>think</b> that
                you have completed a program. Then even more so when you have fixed those bugs that stopped it from working!

                        Already I am in the process of making a program which will save me £200+ each year. It is a capital gains
                        tax calculator for cryptocurrency, and it will produce the information required for submitting my self-assessment
                        tax return to the HMRC. It does this by reading raw trades from a CSV file and distributes them into
                        individual files.
                        <br> I plan to incorporate a database system when I am more familiar with them but this is the guideline for
                        version 1.3.
                        <br> To see what I have written so far for this project

                    </p>
                    <!-- Insight into future projects -->
                    <p> I also have other programs drafted in pseudocode which are intended to benefit those around me. My
                        daughter is desperate for me to create a dinosaur game and my nan is obsessed with jewell-painting, so I
                        would like to create a program for her which converts any image file into a pixelated format that instructs
                        which jewels are to be glue on. Another idea is to create a program which briefly summarises the driving laws
                        of a country, highlighting the differences between your home country and the country selected. </p>
