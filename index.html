        <!-- Subheading hook -->
        <h3><b><em>Thrill seeker and tech geek...</em></b>an odd combination I know but honesty counts.</h3>

        <!-- Bio -->
        <p>Being compassionate with a logical mindset, my ethos is centered around helping others, working with
            people, and making improvements to everyday life. I am also very creative with a passion for art,
            photography, gaming and design layout.</p>


        <!-- Passions -->
        <p>I love the outdoors and am in my element when out there exploring nature. Some of my favourite things to do are
            hiking difficult trails, skiing down the mountains of Europe, or going camping out in the wild with a crackling
            fire.
            When I am not out exploring different places, I transfer this passion to discovering challenges, improving
            efficiency, constructing clean designs and solving problems. This is what ultimately lead me to programming
            which encompasses all of the above. It is a place for me to let this adventurous side loose and to explore
            different ways of creating elegant designs/programs to help make lives better and easier.</p>

        <!-- Interests before programming -->
        <p>Before programming, my tech interests were around blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies which I
            extensively studied and profited from for several years. It was only when I learnt about programming that I
            considered switching career paths. With programming, I could plunge deeper into new emerging technologies and
            become a bigger part of this sector.</p>

        <!-- Ambition -->
        <p> In the future, after extensive learning, my aim is to become a full-stack web developer. By linking together
            the challenges and problem-solving required for back-end development, with the design elements and layout of
            front-end I have my dream job. I love the excitement and sense of achievement felt when you <b>think</b> that
            you have completed a program. Then even more so when you have fixed those bugs that stopped it from working!</p>

        <h2> Completed Projects </h2>

        <h4> Task Management System </h4>
        <p> The user can log in to the system and is presented with a menu which allows them to assign, view or edit tasks.
            If the admin is logged in, there are extra menu features, which allow new users to be created and a statistics
            page is displayed with comprehensive data on task completion for the entire team and each member of staff.<br>
            This was my first project from which I took real pride in upon completion. To view this project in it's
            entirety

        <h4> Product Inventory </h4>
        <p> This project produces various reports based on a companies stock levels and products. The system has
            multiple features which can add new products and place an order to restock the item with the lowest
            quantity.<br> To see this project in greater detail, view my Product Inventory program on GitHub by

        <!-- Programs I am working on and my future plans -->
        <h3>Current and Future Projects</h3>
        <p> Already I am in the process of making a program which will save me £200+ each year. It is a capital gains
            tax calculator for cryptocurrency, and it will produce the information required for submitting my self-assessment
            tax return to the HMRC. It does this by reading raw trades from a CSV file and distributes them into
            individual files. <br>
            I plan to incorporate a database system when I am more familiar with them but this is the guideline for
            version 1.3.
            <br> To see what I have written so far for this project
            <a href="https://github.com/CarneyCreations/capital_gains_calculator/blob/main/capital_gains_calculator.py"
            target="_blank">click here.</a></p>

        <!-- Insight into future projects -->
        <p> I also have other programs drafted in pseudocode which are intended to benefit those around me. My
            daughter is desperate for me to create a dinosaur game and my nan is obsessed with jewell-painting, so I
            would like to create a program for her which converts any image file into a pixelated format that instructs
            which jewels are to be glue on. Another idea is to create a program which briefly summarises the driving laws
            of a country, highlighting the differences between your home country and the country selected.</p>
