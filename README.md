# Personal Web1.page https://carneycreations.github.io/personal_webpage/
This is the first webpage I created with HTML and CSS. 

## Surprises
The HTML side I found really fun which I did not expect. I love the cascading wave you create as the page gets longer. With CSS I wasn't as convinced. Having worked with Adobe Creative Suite before, I cannot understand why webpages are created with inline code instead of objects and text being moved around. 

As HTML and CSS are so popular, I feel that I currently have an unpopular opinion and am curious as to whether this will change in future projects. I am aware this could just be because the software is new to me and I have to learn more before I can work with it better. Still, this was my first time using it. Persistence is key! 

# Issues
I found certain aspects of creating this webpage very challenging. 
* Changing my IDE to a web-design friendly one helped a lot with both visualising the changes I was making and also for suggestions.
* In the Transferable Skills section, I found my biggest challenge - creating a horizontal list which wrapped and where the items didn't overlap.
  * Most of the reason I found this difficult was down to simply not knowing enough about the CSS settings. There were so many options that I found myself overwhelmed. Eventually I worked out how to do it to almost how I had it in mind. My next project introduced me to responsive design and I wish I had learned this before attempting the horizontal list. col-md-3 would have been invaluable to know at that time and would have saved me several hours of research!

I feel like the overall outcome of this project resembles that of a webpage from 15-20 years ago,which makes me chuckle, however I understand I had to start somewhere. Things can only get better!
